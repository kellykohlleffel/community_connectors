# BAI2 SFTP Connector Example

Fivetran custom connector that fetches BAI2-format cash management files from an SFTP server and loads all transactions into a single `bai2_transactions` table in your destination.

---

## Connector overview

BAI2 (Bank Administration Institute version 2) is the de facto US standard for bank-to-corporate cash management reporting. Banks deliver one file per day containing all account activity for the prior 24 hours.

This connector:
- Connects to an SFTP server and lists files in a configured directory
- Picks up any files not yet processed (incremental — no reprocessing)
- Parses the BAI2 hierarchical record structure into flat transaction rows
- Denormalizes account balance summaries (opening balance, closing balance, etc.) onto every transaction row
- Parses structured ACH fields from narrative continuation records inline
- Checkpoints after each file so a mid-run failure does not reprocess completed files
- Tracks any file-level failures in state for operational visibility

---

## Requirements

- [Supported Python versions](https://github.com/fivetran/fivetran_connector_sdk/blob/main/README.md#requirements)
- Operating system:
  - Windows: 10 or later (64-bit only)
  - macOS: 13 (Ventura) or later (Apple Silicon [arm64] or Intel [x86_64])
  - Linux: Distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, or Amazon Linux 2 or later (arm64 or x86_64)

---

## Getting started

Refer to the [Connector SDK Setup Guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/connector-sdk/setup-guide) to get started.

To run the connector locally:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install fivetran-connector-sdk paramiko
   ```

2. Fill in your credentials in `configuration.json`.

3. Run the connector locally using the Fivetran debug command:

   ```bash
   fivetran debug
   ```

   This executes the sync locally, prints all log output, and writes results to a local `warehouse.db` SQLite file for inspection.

To validate syntax before debugging:

```bash
python -m py_compile connector.py && echo "OK"
```

## Features

- Incremental sync using processed filenames as cursors — files are never reprocessed
- BAI2 hierarchical record structure (01/02/03/16/88) parsed into flat transaction rows
- Account balance summaries (Record 03) denormalized onto every transaction row as `balance_{type_code}` columns — new type codes appear automatically on first sync
- Structured ACH fields parsed from 88-record narrative text into dedicated `ach_*` columns
- Checkpoint per file — a mid-run failure does not reprocess already-completed files
- File-level failure tracking in state for operational visibility
- Exponential backoff with jitter on SFTP connection retries (up to 5 attempts, delays 5 s → ~10 s → ~20 s → ~40 s)
- Optional test mode to limit each sync to 3 files for initial validation

---

## BAI2 file structure

A BAI2 file is comma-delimited with a hierarchical record structure. Each record is identified by a numeric code as its first field:

```
01 - File Header        (1 per file)
  02 - Group Header     (1 per file, represents the originating bank)
    03 - Account Summary  (1 per account — contains balance type codes)
    88 - Continuation     (extends the preceding record's field list)
      16 - Transaction    (1 per debit/credit)
      88 - Continuation   (extends the transaction narrative text)
    49 - Account Trailer
  98 - Group Trailer
99 - File Trailer
```

Records 49, 98, and 99 (trailers) contain control totals only and are not loaded into the destination.

## Configuration file

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sftp_host` | Yes | SFTP server hostname or IP address |
| `sftp_port` | No | SFTP port (default: `22`). Must be a valid integer between 1 and 65535. |
| `sftp_username` | Yes | SFTP username |
| `sftp_password` | Yes | SFTP password for authentication. Must not be empty. |
| `sftp_remote_path` | Yes | Directory path on the SFTP server where BAI2 files are deposited. Must not be empty. |
| `sftp_file_pattern` | No | Regex pattern to filter filenames (e.g. `web\..*\.prev\.out\..*`). When omitted, all files in the directory are processed. Validated at startup — an invalid regex raises an error before any connection is attempted. |
| `test_mode` | No | Set to `"true"` to limit each sync to 3 files. SFTP connection is made normally — all credentials still required. See [Test mode](#test-mode) below. |

Example `configuration.json`:

```json
{
    "sftp_host": "sftp.yourbank.com",
    "sftp_port": "22",
    "sftp_username": "your_sftp_username",
    "sftp_password": "your_sftp_password",
    "sftp_remote_path": "/outgoing/bai2/",
    "sftp_file_pattern": "web\\..*\\.prev\\.out\\..*"
}
```

Note: Ensure that the `configuration.json` file is not checked into version control to protect sensitive information.

---

## Requirements file

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the Python libraries required by this connector:

```
paramiko==3.5.1
```

Note: The `fivetran_connector_sdk` and `requests` packages are pre-installed in the Fivetran environment and must not be declared in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Authentication

This connector uses password authentication over SFTP. Provide `sftp_host`, `sftp_username`, and `sftp_password` in `configuration.json`. For production deployments, store credentials in Fivetran's encrypted secrets store rather than in `configuration.json`.

---

## Connection reliability

The connector is built for production SFTP environments with several reliability features:

- TCP/banner/auth timeouts – the SSH connection uses `timeout=30s`, `banner_timeout=30s`, and `auth_timeout=30s` to prevent hanging at any phase of the SSH handshake.
- SFTP operation timeout – after the SFTP session is opened, all file operations (directory listing, file reads) are subject to a 60-second channel timeout.
- Exponential backoff with jitter – connection failures are retried up to 5 times. Delays increase exponentially (5 s → ~10 s → ~20 s → ~40 s) with proportional jitter (±30%) capped at 60 seconds, preventing thundering-herd behaviour when multiple instances retry simultaneously.

---

## Data handling

- Incremental – files are processed once and never reprocessed. The filename is used as the cursor.
- One file per day – the bank delivers one BAI2 file per day. If no new file is present, the sync completes with no rows written.
- Chronological order – new files are sorted alphabetically before processing. Because BAI2 filenames embed a timestamp (e.g. `web.galls.prev.out.20260102.144521`), alphabetical order is equivalent to chronological order.
- Checkpoint per file – state is saved after each file is fully processed. If a sync is interrupted, already-completed files are not reprocessed on the next run.
- Row-level error handling – if an individual record fails to parse, a warning is logged and that row is skipped. The rest of the file continues processing. A summary log line at the end of each file reports how many transactions were parsed and how many records were skipped.

---

## Error handling

- File-level errors – if an entire file fails (SFTP read error, unrecoverable parse failure), the failure is recorded in `state["failed_files"]` with the error type and message, a checkpoint is saved, and the connector moves on to the next file. The failed file is not added to `processed_files` and will be retried on the next sync.
- Connection errors – SFTP connection failures are retried up to 5 times with exponential backoff before raising a `RuntimeError`. See [Connection reliability](#connection-reliability) for details.

## Tables created

### `bai2_transactions`

One row per transaction (Record 16). Balance summary data from Record 03 is denormalized onto every row for that account.

#### Core fields

| `btid` | INT | Synthetic | Auto-incrementing primary key, persisted across syncs |
| `file_reference` | STRING | Filename | Source filename (e.g. `web.galls.prev.out.20260102.144521`) |
| `file_date` | DATE | Record 01 | Date the file was created (YYMMDD → ISO) |
| `file_creation_time` | STRING | Record 01 | Time the file was created (HHMM) |
| `sender_id` | STRING | Record 01 | Bank routing number or sender identifier |
| `receiver_id` | STRING | Record 01 | Receiving system identifier |

| `as_of_time` | STRING | Record 02 | Time of reporting (HHMM) |
| `originator_id` | STRING | Record 02 | Bank SWIFT/routing number |
| `bank_account_number` | STRING | Record 03 | Bank account number |
| `currency` | STRING | Record 02/03 | ISO 4217 currency code (e.g. `USD`) |

#### Transaction fields (Record 16)

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `type_code` | STRING | BAI2 transaction type code (e.g. `145` = ACH Credit) |
| `amount` | FLOAT | Transaction amount in currency units (e.g. `29.43`) |
| `debit_credit_mark` | STRING | `C` (credit) or `D` (debit), derived from type code range |
| `funds_type` | STRING | Funds availability indicator (`S`, `0`, `D`, `V`, `Z`) |
| `same_day_amount` | FLOAT | Same-day available portion (when `funds_type = S`) |
| `one_day_amount` | FLOAT | One-day available portion (when `funds_type = S`) |
| `two_plus_day_amount` | FLOAT | Two-or-more-day portion (when `funds_type = S`) |
| `bank_reference` | STRING | Unique transaction ID assigned by the bank |
| `customer_reference` | STRING | Corporate reconciliation reference |
| `description` | STRING | Full narrative text (inline 88 records merged) |

#### ACH structured fields (parsed from 88 narrative)

These columns are populated for ACH transactions where the bank embeds structured data in the narrative continuation records.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `ach_cust_id` | ACH customer ID |
| `ach_description` | ACH description / payment type |
| `ach_comp_name` | Originating company name |
| `ach_comp_id` | Originating company ID |
| `ach_batch_discr` | Batch discriminator |
| `ach_sec_code` | Standard Entry Class code (e.g. `CCD`, `CTX`, `PPD`) |
| `ach_cust_name` | Customer name from ACH record |
| `ach_tran_date` | Transaction date from ACH record |
| `ach_tran_time` | Transaction time from ACH record |
| `ach_addenda` | Addenda indicator (`No Addenda` or `See EDI Report`) |

#### Balance summary columns (Record 03, denormalized)

Balance columns are named `balance_{type_code}` and appear dynamically based on what the bank reports. Common codes:

| Column | BAI2 code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `balance_010` | 010 | Opening Ledger Balance |
| `balance_015` | 015 | Closing Ledger Balance |
| `balance_040` | 040 | Opening Available Balance |
| `balance_045` | 045 | Opening Available + Same-Day ACH |
| `balance_072` | 072 | Adjusted Closing Available Balance |
| `balance_074` | 074 | Adjusted Opening Available Balance |
| `balance_100` | 100 | Total Credits |
| `balance_110` | 110 | Total Lockbox Deposits |
| `balance_140` | 140 | Total ACH Credits Received |
| `balance_400` | 400 | Total Debits |
| `balance_550` | 550 | ZBA / Deposit Interest |
| `balance_570` | 570 | Available Balance |

Any additional type codes reported by the bank appear as new columns automatically on first sync. Amounts are in currency units (e.g. `209212.42`). A value of `0.0` means the bank reported a zero balance; `NULL` means the type code was not reported for that account.

---

## State management

The connector persists the following values in Fivetran state between syncs:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `processed_files` | JSON array of filenames already processed — prevents reprocessing |
| `next_btid` | Next available `btid` value — ensures the primary key increments globally across all files |
| `failed_files` | JSON array of files that failed to process (capped at 100 entries). Each entry contains `filename`, `error_type`, `error` (truncated to 200 chars), and `timestamp`. Used for operational visibility — failed files require manual investigation. |

To reprocess a failed file after resolving the underlying issue, navigate to your connector in the Fivetran dashboard, then go to **Settings** → **Reset State**. Alternatively, remove the filename from `failed_files` in state — it was never added to `processed_files`, so it will be picked up automatically on the next sync.

---

## Test mode

Test mode connects to the real SFTP server but limits each sync to 3 files. Use it during initial setup to validate connectivity and parsing against live data without processing the full backlog.

When `test_mode` is `"true"`:
- SFTP connection is made normally — all credentials are still required.
- Only the first 3 unprocessed files (alphabetical order) are processed per sync.
- State and `processed_files` are updated normally after each file, so subsequent syncs continue where test mode left off.
- Disable `test_mode` (set to `"false"` or remove the key) once the integration is validated.

Example `configuration.json` for test mode:

```json
{
    "sftp_host": "sftp.yourbank.com",
    "sftp_port": "22",
    "sftp_username": "your_sftp_username",
    "sftp_password": "your_sftp_password",
    "sftp_remote_path": "/outgoing/bai2/",
    "sftp_file_pattern": "web\\..*\\.prev\\.out\\..*",
    "test_mode": "true"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `Missing required configuration key(s)` | One of the required keys is absent from `configuration.json` | Verify all four required keys (`sftp_host`, `sftp_username`, `sftp_password`, `sftp_remote_path`) are present and non-empty |
| `sftp_password cannot be empty` | Password value is an empty string | Provide the SFTP password in `configuration.json` |
| `sftp_port must be between 1 and 65535` | Port value is out of range or not a valid integer | Correct the `sftp_port` value in `configuration.json` |
| `sftp_remote_path cannot be empty` | Remote path is an empty string | Provide the directory path on the SFTP server |
| `Failed to connect to SFTP after 5 attempts` | Wrong host/port, firewall blocking the port, or incorrect password | Confirm SFTP credentials; test with an SFTP client |
| `paramiko.ssh_exception.AuthenticationException` | Password is incorrect or the SFTP user account is locked | Verify the password with the bank's IT team |
| `[Errno 2] No such file` on `sftp.listdir` | `sftp_remote_path` does not exist on the server | Confirm the directory path with the bank's IT team |
| `Invalid sftp_file_pattern regex` | `sftp_file_pattern` contains an invalid regex (e.g. unclosed bracket) | Fix the pattern syntax; test with `python -c "import re; re.compile(r'your_pattern')"` |
| 0 rows processed but files exist | `sftp_file_pattern` regex does not match the actual filenames | Test the pattern: `python -c "import re; print(re.search(r'your_pattern', 'your_filename'))"` |
| Balance columns are all `NULL` | BAI2 file has no Record 03 before the Record 16s | Contact the bank — a valid BAI2 file must include account summary records |
| `btid` gaps between syncs | Expected behaviour — btid increments globally and gaps occur when rows are skipped | Not an error; check logs for `Skipping record` warnings on the relevant sync |
| File appears in `failed_files` state | File-level failure (SFTP error, unrecoverable parse error) | Check `error_type` and `error` fields in state for the cause; resolve the underlying issue; the file will be retried automatically on the next sync |
| `test_mode must be 'true' or 'false'` | `test_mode` value is not a recognised string | Set `test_mode` to `"true"` or `"false"` |
| Only 3 files processed despite more being available | `test_mode` is `"true"` | Set `test_mode` to `"false"` or remove the key once validation is complete |

## Deployment

To deploy the connector to Fivetran after local testing:

```bash
fivetran connector deploy \
  --connector-id <your-connector-id> \
  --destination <your-destination-group-name>
```

Note: The API key must be base64-encoded as `key:secret`. Use the Fivetran group name (not the group ID) for `--destination`.
